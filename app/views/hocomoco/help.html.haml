          <b>Q:</b> Can you explain the structure of motif IDs?
        .answer
          <b>A:</b> Let's use #{link_to 'AHR.H12CORE.0.P.B', motif_path('AHR.H12CORE.0.P.B')} as an example.
          %br
          Here <u>AHR</u> denotes the UniProt AC prefix (most of the time identical between human and mouse orthologs, e.g. AHR_HUMAN and AHR_MOUSE). 
          %br
          <u>H12CORE</u> denotes the subcollection, and can also be H12RSNP/H12INVIVO/H12INVITRO in downloadable motifs sets.
          %br
          <u>0</u> is the subtype number, where 0 denotes the most common motifs scoring the best across all benchmarking datasets.
          %br
          <u>P</u> is the type of the experiment that yielded motifs that were assigned to the subtype during expert curation. Can be <b>P</b> (ChIP-Seq), S (HT-<b>S</b>ELEX), or M (<b>M</b>ethyl-HT-SELEX), or any combination of those three for motifs found in several types of experiments. 
          %br
          <u>B</u> is the motif quality on the ABCD scale, see below.

        .question
          <b>Q:</b> In HOCOMOCO v11 there were separate mouse and human collections, why is there only one joint collection in v12?
        .answer
          <b>A:</b> Even in HOCOMOCO v11 we were relying on cross-validation between human and mouse datasets. As human and mouse TFs share highly similar and often identical DNA-binding domains, we have taken the next step and selected the most reliable motif well-performing across the whole range of available data for both species. Based on benchmarking results, we consider v12 motifs to be generally more informative and more reliable than in the previous releases. Please check the HOCOMOCO v12 paper for more details.

        .question
          <b>Q:</b> Where is the dinucleotide motif collection of HOCOMOCO v11?
        .answer
          <b>A:</b> In this release, we have focused our efforts on expanding the fraction of TFs covered by reliable motifs, rigorous benchmarking, and comprehensive annotation of motif subtypes. Dinucleotide motifs will continue to be available in HOCOMOCO v11.

      .qa-section
        .question
          <b>Q:</b> There are four motif subcollections, right? Which I am browsing online and which I should use in my analysis?
        .answer
          <b>A:</b> The website catalog is devoted to the primary and the most universal core collection providing the motifs that excel across the whole set of benchmarking protocols and datasets. In case of doubt, you may safely use v12-core collection.
          %br
          However, in particular usage scenarios, you may prefer v12-invivo (for genomic TFBS), v12-invitro (for high-affinity oligos), or v12-rSNP (for analyzing regulatory variation) sets.

        HOmo sapiens COmprehensive MOdel COllection (HOCOMOCO) contains transcription factor (TF) binding motifs represented as classic #{link_to 'Position Weight Matrices', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix'} (PWMs, also known as Position-Specific Scoring Matrices, PSSMs).

        HOCOMOCO #{link_to 'motifs', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif'} were constructed with #{link_to 'ChIPMunk', 'https://autosome.org/ChIPMunk/'} by systematic motif discovery from thousands of ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX datasets. Please refer to the HOCOMOCO v12 paper for more details on the motif discovery procedure.

        HOCOMOCO provides PWMs accompanied by precomputed score thresholds. The thresholds and P-value for HOCOMOCO v12 motifs are estimated against uniform background probabilities. To interactively visualize predicted TFBS in a small set of sequences we provide #{link_to 'MoLoTool', 'https://molotool.autosome.org/'}. For large-scale analysis, we suggest using command-line tools, such as our #{link_to 'SPRY-SARUS', 'https://github.com/autosome-ru/sarus'} or MEME's #{link_to 'FIMO', 'https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/fimo.html'}.

        %a.section_subheader{href: '#motif_benchmarking'} [Motif benchmarking; Performance metrics]
      %p
        To assemble the motif collection of HOCOMOCO v12 we have used multiple benchmarking protocols evaluating the motif performance for TFBS recognition in genomic regions (in vivo data, ChIP-Seq), in artificial oligonucleotides (in vitro data, HT-SELEX), and for predicting regulatory single-nucleotide variants and polymorphisms (rSNPs). Please refer to the HOCOMOCO v12 paper for more details on benchmarking protocols and resulting performance metrics.

        %a.section_subheader{href: '#description_quality_score'} [Quality ratings]
      %p
        Each model in the collection has a quality rating from A to D where A represents motifs with the highest confidence. A quality motifs are found in both HT-SELEX and ChIP-Seq, B quality motifs are found in at least two different experiments of the same type, and C quality motifs are found in a single experiment but passed expert curation. In the core collection, D marks motifs inherited from HOCOMOCO v11, and there are only a few D quality motifs. In sub-collections, D quality denotes all motifs not tested in the respective benchmarks (ChIP-Seq for v12-invivo, HT-SELEX for v12-invitro, rSNP for v12-rsnp).

        %a.section_subheader{href: '#motif_subtypes'} [Motif subtypes]
      %p
        Since v11 the alternative binding motifs of a particular TF are ranked from 0 (the primary model) to 1,2,.. (the alternative motifs). The motifs of 0 rank are the most 'general' variants with the best performance across available data in the benchmark (see the HOCOMOCO v12 paper for details).
      %p
        %a.section_subheader{href: '#experimental_data_types'} [Experimental data types]
      %p
        HOCOMOCO v12 used two data types for motif discovery: ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX. The latter came in two variants: traditional HT-SELEX and methyl-HT-SELEX with mCpGs. Additionally, in benchmarking, we used information on differential transcription factor binding to single-nucleotide variants obtained in SNP-SELEX and identified from ChIP-Seq (the allele-specific binding, see #{link_to 'ADASTRA', 'https://adastra.autosome.org/'}).
