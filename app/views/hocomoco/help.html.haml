        HOmo sapiens COmprehensive MOdel COllection (HOCOMOCO) contains transcription factor (TF) binding motifs represented as classic #{link_to 'Position Weight Matrices', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix'} (PWMs, also known as Position-Specific Scoring Matrices, PSSMs).
      %p
        The PCM to PWM conversion scheme used in HOCOMOCO follows that of MACRO-APE, see the respective #{link_to 'manual', 'http://opera.autosome.org/downloads/MACRO-PERFECTOS-APE_manual.pdf'}, page 20â€“21. Uniform background was used in this process, as well as when estimating the downloadable threshold-to-P-value tables.

        HOCOMOCO #{link_to 'motifs', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif'} were constructed with #{link_to 'ChIPMunk', 'https://autosome.org/ChIPMunk/'} by systematic motif discovery from thousands of ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX datasets. Please refer to the #{link_to 'HOCOMOCO v12 paper', 'https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1077'} for more details on the motif discovery procedure. And to the #{link_to 'Codebook MEX paper', 'https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.11.619379'} for details on data sources and motif discovery pipeline for v13 update.

        HOCOMOCO provides PWMs accompanied by precomputed score thresholds. The thresholds and P-value for HOCOMOCO v13 motifs are estimated against uniform background probabilities. To interactively visualize predicted TFBS in a small set of sequences we provide #{link_to 'MoLoTool', 'https://molotool.autosome.org/'}. For large-scale analysis, we suggest using command-line tools, such as our #{link_to 'SPRY-SARUS', 'https://github.com/autosome-ru/sarus'} or MEME's #{link_to 'FIMO', 'https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/fimo.html'}.

      %p
        To assemble the motif collection of HOCOMOCO v13 we have used multiple benchmarking protocols evaluating the motif performance for TFBS recognition in genomic regions (<i>in vivo</i> data: ChIP-Seq), in artificial oligonucleotides (<i>in vitro</i> data: HT-SELEX, GHT-SELEX, SMiLE-Seq and PBM), and for predicting regulatory single-nucleotide variants and polymorphisms (rSNPs). Please refer to the HOCOMOCO v12 and Codebook MEX papers, and <a href="https://mex.autosome.org/">Codebook MEX website</a> for more details on benchmarking protocols and resulting performance metrics.

        %a.section_subheader#description_quality_score{href: '#description_quality_score'} [Quality ratings]
      %p
        Each model in the collection has a quality rating from <b>A</b> to <b>D</b> where <b>A</b> represents motifs with the highest confidence. <b>A</b> quality motifs and subtypes were found in at least two types of assays (ChIP-Seq, HT-SELEX, GHT-SELEX, SMiLE-Seq or PBM), <b>B</b> quality motifs are found in at least two different experiments of the same type, and <b>C</b> quality motifs passed expert curation but were found in a single experiment. In the core collection, <b>D</b> quality marks subtypes which included only motifs inherited from HOCOMOCO v11, and in v13 there are only a few such cases. In sub-collections, <b>D</b> quality denotes all motifs not tested in the respective benchmarks (ChIP-Seq for v13-invivo, neither of HT-SELEX, GHT-SELEX, SMiLE-Seq, PBM for v13-invitro, rSNP for v13-rsnp).

      %p
        Since v11 the alternative binding motifs of a particular TF are ranked from 0 (the primary model) to 1,2,.. (the alternative motifs). The motifs of 0 rank are the most 'general' variants with the best performance across available data in the benchmark (see the HOCOMOCO v12 paper for details).

        %a.section_subheader#experimental_data_types{href: '#experimental_data_types'} [Experimental data types]
      %p
        HOCOMOCO v12 used two data types for motif discovery: ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX. The latter came in two variants: traditional HT-SELEX and methyl-HT-SELEX with mCpGs.
        In HOCOMOCO v13 three additional data types were used: GHT-SELEX (HT-SELEX analogue with input library collected from random genomic sequences), SMiLE-Seq, and PBM.
        Additionally, in benchmarking, we used information on differential transcription factor binding to single-nucleotide variants obtained in SNP-SELEX and identified from ChIP-Seq (the allele-specific binding, see #{link_to 'ADASTRA', 'https://adastra.autosome.org/'}).

        Motif name encodes experiment types that yielded motifs assigned to the same subtype during expert curation. We use the following abbreviations of experiment types: P (ChI<b>P</b>-Seq), S (HT-<b>S</b>ELEX), M (<b>M</b>ethyl-HT-SELEX), G (<b>G</b>enomic HT-SELEX), I (SM<b>i</b>Le-Seq), and B (P<b>B</b>M). Motif name can represent any combination of those six (PSMGIB) for motifs found in several types of experiments.
