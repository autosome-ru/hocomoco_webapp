        HOmo sapiens COmprehensive MOdel COllection (HOCOMOCO) contains transcription factor (TF) binding models represented as classic
        #{link_to 'Position Weight Matrices', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix'} (PWMs, also known as Position-Specific Scoring Matrices, PSSMs)
        and precalculated score thresholds.
      %p
        The dinucleotide PWMs provide better TFBS recognition quality and are also available for selected TFs, primarily for those with ChIP-Seq data available
        (see #{link_to 'diChIPMunk', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23427986'} and #{link_to 'HOCOMOCO', 'https://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/D1/D116'} papers
        for details).
      %p
        PWMs in HOCOMOCO v9 were derived from various types of experimental data using data integration by #{link_to 'ChIPMunk', 'https://autosome.org/ChIPMunk/'}
        motif discovery tool. HOCOMOCO v10 and v11 updates were primarily based on high-throughput sequencing data.

      %p
        HOCOMOCO provides mono- and dinucleotide PWMs and precomputed score thresholds for download. To visualize predicted TFBS in a small set of
        sequences we provide #{link_to 'MoLoTool', 'https://molotool.autosome.org/'}.
        A dedicated #{link_to 'web-interface', 'https://micro.biouml.org/bioumlweb/hocomoco.html'} in BioUML is also suitable for this task.
        For large-scale analysis we suggest to use command-line tools, such as #{link_to 'SPRY-SARUS', 'https://github.com/vorontsovie/sarus'}.

        %a.section_header{href: '#description_quality_score'} [Quality score]
      %p
        Each model in the collection has a quality rating from A to D where A represents motifs with the highest confidence, and models down to C quality are suitable
        for quantitative analyses. A motif of D quality provides only rough description of a binding pattern and should be used primarily in exploration studies.
        The details on quality assignment can be found in the most recent HOCOMOCO paper.

      %p
        %a.section_header{href: '#description_auc'} [auROC]
      %p
        auROC (Area Under for ROC curve) represents the power of a given model to discriminate true positive ChIP-Seq segments from random noise.
        The best AUC across all peak sets shows the highest value reachable for the selected transcription factor.

      %p
        %a.section_header{href: '#description_rank'} [Motif rank]
      %p
        Since v11 the alternative binding models of a particular TF are ranked from 0 (the primary model) to 1 and 2 (the alternative models, including single-box variants).
        The models of 0 rank is the most 'general' variant with the best weighted performance in the cross-validation benchmark (see the HOCOMOCO paper for details).

      %p
        %a.section_header{href: '#core_full_collections'} [Core/Full collections]
      %p
        CORE COLLECTION: primary binding motifs that robustly represent binding sites across multiple experiments.
        The CORE collection contains models of ABC quality and 0 rank only.
      %p
        FULL COLLECTION: core collection plus all the high-quality alternative and lower-reliability binding models built from limited experimental data.
        The FULL collection contains models of ABCD quality and 0-1-2 ranks.

      %p
        %a.section_header{href: '#api_description'} [API description]
      %p
        HOCOMOCO provides JSON-API in order to programmatically get information about a motif. See API #{link_to 'help page', api_description_path} for details.
